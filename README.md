# TheNthD

## Updated project
This project has been moved to a new repo, as it was moved from WinForms to MonoGame. This means MonoGame deals with the drawing code, which will likely preform better than me trying to write my own optimized drawing algorthims.

The new repo can be found at: https://github.com/Exeton/ANewWorld


## Info
This is a WIP video game. More info will be added at later stages of development. This project is also being migrated to XNA.

The game currently has basic physics, a moving camera, and a sample enemy.
